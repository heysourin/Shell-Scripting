## Introduction to Shell Scripting

Shell scripting is a way to automate tasks and create programs using shell commands. A shell script is a sequence of commands that can be executed in a shell environment. Shell scripts are commonly used for system administration, automation, and other tasks.

## Getting Started

To start learning shell scripting, you need:

- A text editor (e.g., `vim`, `nano`, `sublime text`) for writing scripts.
- A shell interpreter (e.g., `bash`, `sh`) to execute the scripts.

## Basic Syntax

Shell scripts are plain text files. They start with a shebang line that specifies the interpreter:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
